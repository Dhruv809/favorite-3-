       <p>Dhoni's work :  Dhoni holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd., after resigning from Air India. India Cements is the owner of the Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first IPL season. He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014.    Kohli's work:  Laxman also added that Virat Kohli has done a tremendous job as the captain of Team India in the last four years, but said that there was always scope for improvement and as time passes Kohli will only get better. â€œI think he has done a fantastic job for Team India as a Test match captain.
